# Decision Tree Project README

## Description
This Java project utilizes the C4.5 algorithm to build a decision tree. The decision tree is a powerful machine learning technique that can be used for classification tasks. The C4.5 algorithm is an extension of the ID3 algorithm and can handle both categorical and continuous data.

## Getting Started
To use this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/decision-tree-c4.5-java.git`
2. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.
3. Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
4. Build the project to compile the source code.

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset in a compatible format. Ensure that the dataset contains both input features and corresponding target labels.
2. Locate the `Form.java` file in your IDE.
3. Update the file path or database connection details in the `Form.java` file to load your dataset.
4. Customize the parameters and settings in the `Form.java` file according to your requirements.
5. Run the `Form.java` file to execute the program.
6. The decision tree will be built using the C4.5 algorithm based on the provided dataset and settings.
7. The resulting decision tree will be displayed in the console or saved to a file, depending on the implementation.
